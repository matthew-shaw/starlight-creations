##### Q: How can I take care of my piece?

If the item is wood this will apply to most pieces - inner bark of your item has been finished using a natural wax to enrich and protect the surface. To maintain this protection and appearance I strongly suggest not keeping your item in direct sunlight for long periods (to avoid bleaching the wood) and a little treatment of wax about every 12-18 months to maintain the colour and a protective surface.

My personal preference is Craftsman Timber Wax (which I have used to finish these items) for its quality, its natural base and its beautiful scent! Please feel free to contact me using the links below if you would like to know where to purchase this wax or for any further care instructions. For glass pieces feel free to contact me.

- I would recommend not leaving our wood products in direct sunlight for long periods of time to prevent long term bleaching of any exposed inner bark.
- An occasional light dusting with a gentle household product or a beeswax treatment would be beneficial for the long term care of your item.

##### Q: Wholesale availability

I do make items to order and are available wholesale - to enquire about this please contact me using the links below.

##### Q: I cannot fit tealights into my wooden piece

As with any natural product it is possible that the wood has slightly contracted, this can be due to a change in temperature or moisture level.

To fix this problem simply take a small piece of sand paper (ideally 100 grit or above to maintain texture) and carefully sand the inside sides of the tealight holder hole for approximately 1-2 minutes. This should widen the hole again enabling use of the product. Alternatively a dremel tool using a sand barrel can also be used to widen the hole.

Should you need any further assistance please don't hesitate to contact me using the links below and I will happily advise.

##### Q: How can I keep my piece safe?

I take great care to ensure the quality and safety of my products and would like to offer this advice to keep it safe and in good order.

- NEVER leave naked flames unsupervised (when using tealights etc)
- Always place our holders on a steady surface well out of reach of children and pets.
- Please note all Starlight Creations are sold as ornaments/decorations - they are not toys.
