## Rental period

Rental quotations are based on items being rented and returned within a 24 hour period – items rented for a longer period of time will be subject to an additional charge within the quotation. Additionally, if items are not returned within the agreed 24 hour period/at the pre-appointed time please note that this may incur an additional charge of 25% per item (based on their rental cost) taken from the refundable safety deposit.

## Delivery

Standard rental cost of items does not include delivery to or from the event venue – if delivery is requested this will be a separate cost within the quotation upon consideration from Starlight Creations.

If items are delivered to the venue they will be delivered to the customer or a nominated named person at a pre-arranged time – the customer/nominated person will then sign for the items and therefore be responsible for said items until their return and check to the Starlight Creations workshop or pre-arranged pick up time from the venue.

Items that are delivered to the venue will be appropriately packed to offer reasonable protection during transit – as part of the rental agreement the customer is agreeing to unpack the items, to store item packaging safely, set up as desired (please note, Starlight Creations does not set items up for the customer unless this is part of an individual package and quotation) and to pack away items in the same fashion in which they were provided to the customer for return and check to Starlight Creations.

NB. Nominated person – please consider your choice of nominated person carefully before informing Starlight Creations of their name and contact details in a timely manner – this person will be responsible for receiving, unpacking, setting up, repacking and returning items in good order and at pre-appointed times to Starlight Creations. Starlight Creations strongly recommends the nomination of another event supplier (if they are agreeable) e.g. event florist or a venue representative e.g. event planner.

## Item collection

Collection of items from the Starlight Creations workshop will be at a pre-arranged time between Starlight Creations and the customer. Items will be packed appropriately by Starlight Creations to offer reasonable protection during transit – as part of the rental agreement the customer is agreeing to safely transfer items from the workshop to the venue, to unpack the items, to store item packaging safely, set up as desired (please note, Starlight Creations does not set items up for the customer unless this is part of an individual package and quotation) and to pack away items in the same fashion in which they were provided to the customer for return and to return the items for return and check to the Starlight Creations workshop at a pre-appointed time.

If items are not returned within the agreed 24 hour period please note that this may incur an additional charge of 25% per item (based on their rental cost) taken from the refundable safety deposit.

## Item return and check

An inventory of all items will be taken during packing by Starlight Creations before handing items over to the customer on collection or delivery. This will be signed by the customer/nominated person and a receipt of goods provided. Upon return the items will be counted in using the above inventory to check if items are missing, items will also be checked for any damage whilst they have been out on rental or in transit.

Please note, if items have been damaged in transit to the venue the customer or nominated person MUST take pictures of the item immediately – specifically the damage to the item, contact Starlight Creations immediately and refrain from using the item. Once contacted Starlight Creations can assist in rectifying this issue if possible.

The return inventory will take place whilst the customer/nominated person is present, Starlight Creations will then provide a receipt to the customer to confirm it has received items and note if there are any missing items – please note that unless missing items are returned to the Starlight Creations workshop within 48 hours of the initial return the value of the item for replacement will be taken from the refundable safety deposit.

## Safety Deposit

A safety deposit will be paid by the customer to Starlight Creations to secure booking and to cover the cost of any missing or damaged item/s for replacement item/s to be purchased, made or repaired.

The amount of safety deposit will be dependant on the number and value of items rented and will be included in the quotation.

Upon return to Starlight Creations items will be checked against inventory and for any damage. If the items have been returned on time, are all accounted for against the inventory and undamaged Starlight Creations will refund the customer the full safety deposit within 7 days of return of all items (including any missing items).

If items are not returned within the agreed 24 hour period/at the pre-appointed time this may incur an additional charge of 25% per item (based on their individual rental value) taken from the refundable safety deposit.

If there are any missing items – unless missing items are returned undamaged to Starlight Creations within 48 hours of the initial return the value of the item for replacement will be taken from the refundable safety deposit.

If items are damaged upon return the customer will be sent notes and pictures of the damage to items for records and the value of the item for replacement or repair will be taken from the refundable safety deposit.

Once any charges have been deducted for any of the above the remainder of the safety deposit will be returned to the customer within 7 days of return of all items (including any missing items).

If the safety deposit does not cover the amount required to replace missing or damaged items the customer will be sent an itemised invoice from Starlight Creations which the customer agrees to pay within 7 days.

Should the customer choose to cancel their booking without full payment please note that the safety deposit is non-refundable in this circumstance.

## Payment

Once the quote is agreed, to secure their booking the customer will need to pay the proposed safety deposit (as stated within the quote) within 7 days. The customer will then receive an email from Starlight Creations confirming their booking, an invoice and the agreed payment date.

Once the customer has paid the security deposit the customer and Starlight Creations will agree a date/time for collection from the Starlight Creations workshop or delivery to the event venue and will agree a date/time for return to the Starlight Creations workshop or pick up from the event venue

The customer will also provide contact details for the individual/s picking up items or contact details for the nominated person/s as outlined in the above delivery section.
