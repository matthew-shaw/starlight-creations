Starlight Creations was launched in August 2017 by owner and designer Emma Shaw.

Emma's work is inspired by wild and wonderful Dartmoor and the surrounding area where she has lived for most of her life. In fact all our handmade pieces from Starlight Creations are made using materials from or close to Dartmoor.

Starlight Creations offers unique, handmade pieces for sale and rental - alongside this we also offer other wedding/event rental items that are complimentary to our unique designs such as glass bowls, wishing/memory trees and vintage style bird cages. We're passionate about offering affordable beauty, simplicity and unique designs to our customers for their special day or to have a little piece of Dartmoor in their home.

Our workshop is based in the heart of Dartmoor and provides Emma the space, time and inspiration to design and make beautiful Starlight Creations.

Emma lives with her young daughter, husband and two cats in Devon.
