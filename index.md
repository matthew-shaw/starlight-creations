Hi there! My names Em and am the artist and owner of Starlight Creations!

My little business is based in the heart of Devon, UK on wild and wonderful Dartmoor. I love working in my workshop which has views that inspire me, the windows from my workshop overlook the moors on one side and lush fields on the other.

The wood and other natural products I work with are ethically sourced from Dartmoor and the surrounding areas. Many of the pieces of glass I work with are recycled and/or sourced for their uniqueness.

I’m self taught (& still learning!) and passionate about what I do - I love working with wood, it’s such a beautiful changeable thing to work with. Finding out new ways to work with it, thinking of new and interesting designs is fun, interesting and challenging. I have also been honing my glass engraving and painting skills - a particular favourite is freehand engraving different trees onto glass tealight holders and matching these creations with a beautiful handmade wooden base.

I love the work I do and hope that this comes across in the creations I make, it’s amazing to hear from customers about how happy they are with their purchases and what they are used for - so far many of my ring boxes have been used for carrying rings on wedding days which is so lovely, many tealight holders have been bought as little treats for the customer themselves and many of my creations also make wonderful gifts - it’s great to hear how joyfully they have been given and received.

If you wish to order a bespoke piece or items in a large number please to contact me via the links below - I'm happy to make bespoke items, and have worked with a number of businesses to make my items in a larger number.

Everything sold in my shop is handmade by me in my workshop and I hope my creations provide a little bit of Dartmoor magic to the recipient.
